# SimplePhysics
## Created by Isak "Mino53" Forsberg

This is a very simple 2D physics simulator I am developing in my free time. I am mainly doing it for fun and to see what I am able to do with it.

This project is in a very early state and there is currently no application to test. Once I have created an executable file, this document will be updated.

***Status:*** *WIP*
***Version:*** *0.0*
